# StrengthSync

A CliftonStrengths-based team collaboration app that helps teams discover, leverage, and celebrate their unique strengths through analytics, recognition, and gamification.

## Features

- **Team Analytics**: Domain balance charts, gap analysis, partnership suggestions
- **Skills Directory**: Search and browse team members by strengths and expertise
- **Social Features**: Shoutouts (peer recognition), skill request marketplace, activity feed
- **Gamification**: Points, badges, streaks, leaderboards
- **Challenges**: Team activities like Strengths Bingo
- **Mentorship**: Complementary strength-based matching
- **Strengths Cards**: Digital baseball card-style profile cards
- **Notifications**: Real-time notification system

## Tech Stack

- **Framework**: Next.js 15 (App Router)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM
- **Auth**: NextAuth.js with credentials provider
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **UI**: Custom components + Radix UI primitives

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 20.6 or newer
- Docker Desktop with Docker Compose
- npm
- Render CLI only when running production database diagnostics

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/lcortez-code/strengthsync.git
cd strengthsync
```

2. Create your local configuration:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Local environment and development-tool configuration must never contain a Render PostgreSQL URL. The local database is PostgreSQL in Docker, published only on `127.0.0.1`; its Docker volume is disposable.

3. Install dependencies, start and initialize PostgreSQL, then start the app:

```bash
npm install
npm run db:local:up
npm run db:local:setup
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

## Database Workflow

### Local lifecycle and mutations

```bash
npm run db:local:up
npm run db:local:setup
npm run db:migrate
npm run db:seed
npm run db:local:reset -- --confirm-local-reset
npm run db:local:down
npm run db:local:destroy -- --confirm-local-destroy
```

- `db:local:up` starts the loopback-only PostgreSQL container.
- `db:local:setup` prepares the local database for application development.
- `db:migrate` creates and applies development migrations with `prisma migrate dev`.
- `db:seed` is reference-only. Create application organizations and users through the UI or API.
- The reset and destroy confirmation flags prevent accidental destructive operations on the local database, while the loopback guard blocks non-local targets.
- `db:local:down` stops the container while retaining the disposable local volume; `db:local:destroy` removes it.

### Production migrations

Production schema changes run inside Render with `prisma migrate deploy`. Before
that can work, the existing production database has to be told once that the
baseline migration in `prisma/migrations/` is already applied, and the order of
that step matters. Read [docs/production-database.md](docs/production-database.md)
before deploying a schema change or before emptying the database's `ipAllowList`.

### Production diagnostics

```bash
render login
npm run db:prod:console
```

`render psql` through `npm run db:prod:console` is the only supported local path to the production database. Do not copy a production DSN into application, Prisma, development-tool, or shell configuration.

This path depends on the database's `ipAllowList` containing your IP. Once that
list is emptied, `npm run db:prod:console` stops working and a Render Shell on
the web service becomes the way to reach the database.

## Development

See the [development guide](docs/development.md) for architecture and implementation conventions.

```bash
npm run dev            # Start dev server with Turbopack
npm run build          # Build for production
npm run start          # Start production server
npm run lint           # Run ESLint
npm run type-check     # TypeScript type checking
```

Install the repository commit protection for PostgreSQL URLs:

```bash
npm run hooks:install
```

## Environment Variables

See `.env.example` for all available environment variables.

Required:

- `DATABASE_URL` - PostgreSQL connection string
- `NEXTAUTH_URL` - Application URL
- `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` - Secret for session encryption

Optional:

- `AWS_*` - For S3 file uploads

## CliftonStrengths Data

The app works with CliftonStrengths assessment results. Admins can upload PDF reports to import team members' strengths.
